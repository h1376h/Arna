/// Displays a dialog above the current contents of the app.
///
///
/// This function takes a [builder] which is used to build the dialog widget.
/// Content below the dialog is dimmed with a [ModalBarrier]. The widget returned by the [builder] does not share a
/// context with the location that [showArnaDialog] is originally called from. Use a [StatefulBuilder] or a custom
/// [StatefulWidget] if the dialog needs to update dynamically.
///
/// The [context] argument is used to look up the [Navigator] for the dialog. It is only used when the method is
/// called. Its corresponding widget can be safely removed from the tree before the dialog is closed.
///
/// The [barrierDismissible] argument is used to indicate whether tapping on the barrier will dismiss the dialog. It is
/// `true` by default and can not be `null`.
///
/// The [barrierColor] argument is used to specify the color of the modal barrier that darkens everything below the
/// dialog. If `null` the default color [ArnaColors.barrierColor] is used.
///
/// The [useSafeArea] argument is used to indicate if the dialog should only display in 'safe' areas of the screen not
/// used by the operating system (see [SafeArea] for more details). It is `true` by default, which means the dialog
/// will not overlap operating system areas. If it is set to `false` the dialog will only be constrained by the screen
/// size. It can not be `null`.
///
/// The [useRootNavigator] argument is used to determine whether to push the dialog to the [Navigator] furthest from or
/// nearest to the given `context`. By default, [useRootNavigator] is true and the dialog route created by this method
/// is pushed to the root navigator.
///
/// The [routeSettings] argument is passed to [showGeneralDialog], see [RouteSettings] for details.
///
/// {@macro flutter.widgets.RawDialogRoute}
///
/// If the application has multiple [Navigator] objects, it may be necessary to call
/// `Navigator.of(context, rootNavigator: true).pop(result)` to close the dialog rather than just
/// `Navigator.pop(context, result)`.
///
/// Returns a [Future] that resolves to the value (if any) that was passed to [Navigator.pop] when the dialog was
/// closed.
///
/// ### State Restoration in Dialogs
///
/// Using this method will not enable state restoration for the dialog. In order to enable state restoration for a
/// dialog, use [Navigator.restorablePush] or [Navigator.restorablePushNamed] with [ArnaDialogRoute].
///
/// For more information about state restoration, see [RestorationManager].
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [ArnaAlertDialog], for dialogs that have a row of buttons below a body.
///  * [ArnaDialog], on which [ArnaAlertDialog] is based.
///  * [showGeneralDialog], which allows for customization of the dialog popup.
///  * [DisplayFeatureSubScreen], which documents the specifics of how [DisplayFeature]s can split the screen into
///    sub-screens.
